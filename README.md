# World of Tanks Mod Project
Currently a work in progress, but World of Tanks is a video game I like to play in my down time, and I've been working on this project for awhile, but the end goal is to get the old WoT music they had before they reworked it in patch 1.0
So far I was figured out compatibility with other mods in association to this mod pack, found out that I need the "wwise" program to make the mod work in-game (currently a work in progress)

#Description of World of Tanks: 

World of Tanks (WoT) is a massively multiplayer online game developed by Belarusian company Wargaming, featuring 20th century (1910sâ€“1970s) era combat vehicles.[1] It is built upon a freemium business model where the game is free-to-play, but participants also have the option of paying a fee for use of "premium" features. The focus is on player vs. player gameplay with each player controlling an armored vehicle, from the time of Pre-World War 2, to the Cold War-era.

The player takes control of a single armored tank or self-propelled artillery vehicle of their choice, and is placed into a battle on a random map. The player has control over the vehicle's movement, firing, and can communicate with allied players and all the other players through typed or voice chat. A simple random match is won either by destroying all vehicles on the opposing team or capturing the opposing team's base by staying in it for long enough without being damaged by another tank. There are other game modes that change the rules of the battle, but gameplay mechanics remain the same. World of Tanks contains multiple game mechanics such as camouflage, shell ricochets, and module and personnel damage.

The players in World of Tanks can choose six primary types of battles: random battles, team-training battles, tank-company battles, team battles, stronghold battles and special battles. Historical Battle and Rampage are former options but have since been taken down for improvement due to poor reception following their releases. Within random battles, players can also participate in platoons, groups of two or three players who are put into the same team. There are also missions to be completed in the game modes for varying amounts of rewards. A random battle includes up to 15v15 players; bots may be used to fill gaps.

#Patch notes: 
Found out which songs played at which time, currently working on implementing music files to play when game requests for certain auto at certain times. 
Fixed glitch where double music plays when first entering a battle.
Currently working on learning the wwise program to get a better understanding of how to use the program effectively.
